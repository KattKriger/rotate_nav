            <p>Daughter of Fonzo de Los Zahories (DA) and Ona da Cabana Aconcagua born in Rio de Janeiro under the document number RJG/03/04973. It was a beloved part of a Brazilian family, first living in Tatui, then moving to Sao Paulo for a short while and living the most part of her life in a farm based in the south of Minas Gerais, where she lived happily with other dogs and great nature. As her natural ability was for hunting, she used to kill animals for sport that sadly got into her territory, wild or not, and always scare away intruders that could get close to the edges of the farm. She will always be remembered by everyone who knew her, as she was always a happy and charismatic part of the family.

            <p>The Dogo Argentino (plural Dogos Argentinos) is an Argentine breed of large dog of mastiff type. It was bred in the early twentieth century in Córdoba in central Argentina, primarily for dog-fighting, but also for hunting large game such as peccaries, wild boar and pumas. The foundation stock included a fighting dog of bulldog type, a Bull Terrier and a Mastín del Pirineo.</p>
